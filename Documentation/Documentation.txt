Clash Engine is a complete project that mimics the familiar genre of games in full 3D.
At the beginning, the user builds walls, the configuration of protective and economic objects.
After that, hires characters to attack. Then the process of the game itself begins - the battle.
All characters and buildings have 2-3 levels of strength.
The main building is the owner's house, which must be protected by all means.

        albatros,crow is passive characters


3850 lines of code were written for the asset. Hundreds of hours of time.
It would cost thousands of dollars to fully develop such a product.


All models have ID cards, which makes it easy to change their color.
The asset contains the initial palette of vertex-color values.
Buildings contain 2-7K quads, characters 1.5-4K quads, except for golems (9K).
Models are unwrapped with minimal use of overlaps, most of the sweeps are unique.


All parameters of buildings and characters are adjustable: price, construction time, attack, life, etc.


Each warrior has his own strategic mission - tanks, damage dealers, rushers.
Artificial intelligence of warriors finds a target, reaches it and attacks. If the target is covered by a fence, then either bypasses it or breaks through the wall.
Warriors can both move on the ground and fly. They can be both melee and ranger.


The cannons are attacking the warriors. Configurable to attack unnoticeable and aerial opponents. They have unique types of attacks.


Load
    Shadows
        600k tris - 600 batches
    No shadows
        150k tris - 150 batches


Control
    Move - W / S / A / D - left mouse drag
	Rotate - Q / E - middle mouse
	Scale - R / E
	Choose building in menu - left mouse double click
	Rotate building - right mouse click


To create a building prefab you need:
1. Add the BuildingProperties, BoxCollider and NavMeshObstacle script.
BuildingProperties contains all building parameters.
2. The prefab must contain Environment, Constraction, Space and HealthBar objects.
Environment contains building levels.
Constraction is a prefab for building a building.
Space contains the dimensions of the building. Each additional 1x1 space is marked with a Space object.
The HealthBar monitors the life of the building. Must have HeathBar script.
3. Attach the script GunBehaviour if this building should cause damage.

The created buildings must be entered into the BuildingMenu script in the Buildings parameter.
Also, the tabs of the building construction menu are configured here.


To create a warrior prefab you need:
1. Hang the script MainAI, NavMeshAgent and WarriorProperties.
MainAi is responsible for the behavior of artificial intelligence.
WarriorProperties contains all the parameters of a warrior. Also links to attack particle prefabs.
2. The prefab must contain Warrior and HealthBarWarrior levels.
Character levels must have Animator and WarriorSendDamage script.
The HealthBar controls the character's life. Must have HeathBarWarrior script.
3. To find the way by the warriors, it is necessary to calculate the navigation in the Navigation tab.
If a warrior flies, then he does not depend on NavMesh.
4. Animations of damage and death must contain events (Mesh / Animation / Events).
For attack animation, the event name is SendDamage.
For the death animation, the event name is Dead.

The created warriors are added to the StartAttack script in the AllWarriors parameter.


Data storage:
1. Saving is controlled by three scripts BuildingData, SaveDataTrigger and SaveSystem.
2. SaveDataTrigger hangs on the SaveSystem object. All buildings are added to this script.
Each building is assigned its own index, which is used to recreate the city when loaded.
A fence must be assigned to the zero element.


The GunRadius object determines the attack range of the guns.


Objects on the field are brought into the Forest object, which must be destroyed during the construction of the building.
